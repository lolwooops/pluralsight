serializing model

json - model parameters are accessible and intuitive
fragile, req knowledge of what parameters to serialize 

pickle - can work with any python obj
joblib - run python fn as pipeline
-more efficient at storing large multidim numpy arrays

mitigate training serving skew
-training and pred data processed using the same pipeline
-serialize data transform operations along with model parameters
-easy to do with skl using pipelines
