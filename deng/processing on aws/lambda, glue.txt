runs code snippets
serverless
stateless

scalability (auto)
integrations with other aws services
pay for what you use

integrations
-s3 - trigger with storage related events
-iot - trigger with custom rule
-sns - trigger by sub to a topic


lambda >> create function

add trigger (for integrations) 
- always focus or triggers happen more often

if long processes - use ec2



etl issues
-more data
-changing formats and schemas
-complicated operations (managing infrastructure,handling errors)

etl with glue
-etl focused
-discover and catalog data
-serverless
-fully managed spark cluster

-- easy scaling



glue etl job
services >> aws glue >> side bar - etl >> jobs > add job
>>create new target data set > create tables > data store s3 > format csv > target path >> map source columns to target columns


use cases
data catalog
-unifying view of data
-data source for other services
etl
-batch and stream processing
-prepare data for analysis

anticases
-many small jobs running often
-customize cluster
