emr = elastic map reduce

emr managed hadoop and spark service
-good with aws integrations
-decouples storage of compute 

hdfs - default block size of 128 mb
local file system
emr file system (hdfs on s3)

3 types of nodes
-master - runs yarn (manage resources)  - can have multiple
-core nodes - as many as needed - runs hdfs 
	-scale down slowly to avoid losing data on hdfs
-task nodes - accelerating data processing speed esp for cpu intense

optimizing instance types
batch processing - general purpose (m4)
machine learning - compute (c4)
deep learning - gpu instances (p3)
large hdfs - storage instance (d2)

on demand -- highest flex, highest cost
reserved -- highest commitment, discounts


spot -> testing
on demand, spot task -> production
reserved, spot task - predictable workload
